        <p>The vast array of rivers and canals that Kottayam is blessed with, empty themselves into the picturesque Vembanad Lake. It is a lovely place to go for a picnic and has also turned into a prominent backwater destination. There are many boating, fishing and sightseeing options available in the area. The Kumarakom Tourist Village has many house boating and holiday packages available. Onam brings new life to these waters with stunning Snake Boat Races. As oarsmen in large numbers dictate the rhythm of the water underneath, one is transported to a new dimension altogether.
