        <p>The Thangassery Lighthouse, also known as the Tangasseri Light House, boasts of being the second tallest on the entire coast of Kerala and is thus even one of the most visited lighthouses in the state on this account. Located at Tangasseri in the city of Kollam, it is one of the two lighthouses in the Kollam Metropolitan Area and is presently under the surveillance of the Chennai Directorate General of Lighthouses and Lightships.

            The majestic tower is clearly visible and distinct, with its painted red and white oblique bands, and looks pretty indeed in all its glory and majesty. The tower has a total height of 41 metres, or 135 feet, and has been operational since the year 1902.
